## 🌐 API Access

Programmatically create and monitor payments with two endpoints:

### Create a Payment Request
- `POST /api/payments`
- Body:
  ```json
  {
    "amount": 49.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "token": "SOL",
    "orderId": "order-123",
    "metadata": { "customer": "alice@example.com" }
  }
  ```
- Response contains the autogenerated `paymentId` and a ready-to-share `paymentUrl` (e.g. `https://…/pay/pay_123`).

### Check Payment Status
- `GET /api/payments/{paymentId}`
- Returns payment status, Solana transaction signature, timestamps, and the public ZK proof once verified.

All API-created payments are stored in the same Google Sheets database and flow through the identical ZK verification pipeline. Configure the merchant wallet for API-created payments via the `MERCHANT_ADDRESS` environment variable.
